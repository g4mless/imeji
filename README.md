Windows Photos default app sucks on my pc. So i created this inspired by qView.

Main purpose of this project is making image viewer that lighter than Windows Photos & not using any of web technology just for viewing image.

## Known issue
the app window blinking when u open on maximized state. This because the framework that i use to build this have [issue](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3494) on it

What can I do by far is changing from egui to another framework.
